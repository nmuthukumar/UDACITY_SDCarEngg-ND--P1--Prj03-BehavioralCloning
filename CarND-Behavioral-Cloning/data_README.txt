Folder <./data> -- README
=========================
This Folder contains a very Small Example Dataset in the Structure required for the Correct Execution of <model_beh-clone.py>.

However, the Actual Datasets used for the Training & Validation of the Behavior Cloning Model in this Project were:
1. UDACITY provided Sample Training Dataset.
2. Additional Dataset collected by Myself for Corner Use-Cases, which are hosted in the Folder <../MoreTrainData/>.
